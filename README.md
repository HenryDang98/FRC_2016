# FRC_2016

This year's Robolancer's code can use both RC and Tank Drive to control the robot for increased flexibility, since we use a west coast drive. The FRC 2016 repository takes the pneumatic wheels on the Robolancers' 2016 robot, as well as several other components, to
enhance our playing style. The repository also uses PID and encoders to support the robot during a match to increase the accuracy and precision of the drive train.

# Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository from Github 
2. Right click the project and click *Run as -> WPILib deploy*
