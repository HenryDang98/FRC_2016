# FRC_2016

The Robolancer's code can use both RC and Tank Drive to control this year's robot for flexibility (The Robolancer robot uses 
West Coast Drive for its chasis). The FRC 2016 repository takes the pneumatic wheels on the Robolancers' 2016 robot as well as several other components, to
enhance our playing style. The repository also uses the method of PID and encoders to support the robot
during a match to reduce errors or bugs. The structure of the Robolancer's code also uses Robot Utilities
to make our code easier to decode by others and more organized. 

# Installation Instructions
